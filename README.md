
## Globeia React Counter

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your development machine.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager installed.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anirban-Saha/globeia-counter.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd counter-app
   ```

3. Install project dependencies using npm or Yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

   This will start the development server and open the app in your default web browser.

5. You can now interact with the Counter App. Use the "+" and "-" buttons to increment and decrement the counter, and use the input field to set a maximum value for the counter. Click the "Reset" button to reset the counter to the default value.

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build` or `yarn build`: Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
